# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Project

####  A board of elections requesed for help in an election audit of a recent local election. The tasks we had to do in the module previous to the challenge were as following:

  * calculate total number of votes cast.
  
  * get the entire list of candidated who received votes.
  
  * get total number of votes each candidate received.
  
  * calculate % of votes of individual candidates.
  
  * determine the winner based on popular vote.
  
  * Using this information from the week 3 Module, the assignment was to edit the code by finding the following and add to the final results:
  
  **1. voter turnout fot each county**
  
  **2. the percentage of voted from each couty out of the total count**
  
  **3. The county with the highest turnout**
